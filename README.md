# Weather Dashboard

As a traveler who needs to know the weather for a city of interest, or just a curious user interested in the weather in their own city, this weather app will give you the important details.

## Functionality
The weather dashboard allows the user to see the current weather for the city the user inputs.

After searching, the user will then be greeted with a view of that city's name and the current date.  Under the this, the dashboard displays the city's temperature in Â°F, the humidity percentage, windspeed in MPH, and the UV index.  As shown in the photo below, the UV index has a color-gauge. Low UV levels display green, moderate: yellow, mid-high: orange, high: red, and severe: purple.

A very important feature is that the dashboard stores the weather data even after the user refreshes.

You can also click the stored cities and be taken back to that city's weather information.


## Future Functionality

The dashboard is intended to display not only the current weather of a city, but also that city's 5-day forecast.  This app currently features the backdrops for displaying the five days of weather along with that weather's icons.
